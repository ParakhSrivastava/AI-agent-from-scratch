## Introduction
1. Course notes are provided above
2. What an agent can do: have history of conversations and reply, generate images, solve real-world problems, etc.
3. It is non-deterministic in nature: same output is not guaranteed with same input
4. Agent vs Assistant: Not all assistants are agents.
5. Agent is a thing which can run on a loop and can have access to the tools
6. Assistant is like a LLM or chat-interface, no access to outer world.

## LLM
1. Model: A set of statistics or set of some trained system and have probablities for each labelled data (trained data)
2. LLM: A model that is very good in predicting the next thing coming in a sentence
3. Transformer: Helps model to maintain the context of the query currently going on
4. Tokens: Every 3-4 characters are grouped as one token. Model break letter/word down into numerical way into - vectors and embeddings.
